* [A simple starting base](https://github.com/JBthePenguin/SimpleWebsiteDjango)
* ...

#### Install with bash script
*You need [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed.*

Clone me, copy paste the desired install script where you want to place the root of your website and using source to execute it with a new name in parameter.  
For example, with the simple base:
```sh
source install_simple.sh YourWebsite
```
